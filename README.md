# Analysis-of-COVID-19-Spread
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health and socio-economic systems, prompting the need for advanced analytical tools to understand the patterns and dynamics of its spread. This project employs Random For- est algorithm to explore distinctive groupings and patterns in the transmission of COVID-19 across various regions or countries. By analyzing epidemiological data, the study aims to uncover hidden structures and relationships that may pro- vide valuable insights into the factors influencing the virusâ€™s dissemination. The results of this analysis could contribute to more effective public health interventions and targeted strategies for controlling the spread of the virus.
